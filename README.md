# Climbing Data
After the recent update to 8a.nu, I have realized that keeping track of my personal logbook of ascents of routes and boulders above the grades of 7a and 7A is safer for my record keeping and will be a fun passion project. I initially want to get all my ascent data into a .csv file then build my own web application.

## Ascent Data
Because I do not trust 8a.nu to reliably keep my information and I cannot easily access my data, I need to compile my list of ascents that have been recorded.
